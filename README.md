This repository contains HTML and CSS source codes to mimic a restaurant website, Bar Gansa Restaurant. 

My reason for choosing to mimic this website is that it was a good challenge for me and seemed like a fantastic learning opportunity with regards to HTML and CSS, which proved to be correct. 

Unfortunatly as of when I uploaded this repository, the website 'www.bargansa.co.uk/' has gone offline and I was unable to fully write the source code for it.

The sections I was unable to write the source codes were 'Menu', 'Wines' and the 'About Us' sections.

I learned plenty in this project and also learnt several new techniques, such as Relative URLs and smooth scrolling.
