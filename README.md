This repository contains HTML, CSS and JavaScript source codes to mimic a restaurant website, Bar Gansa Restaurant.

Please note: Some elements were not possible to copy, such as font-family as the Oswald text has to be paid for. However, the purpose of this is to show the current extent of my knowledge of HTML and CSS principles.

My reason for choosing to mimic this website is that it was a good challenge for me and seemed like a fantastic learning opportunity with regards to HTML and CSS, which proved to be correct.

The website this code is based on is www.bargansa.co.uk/

Some points to note about this source code:

1. In the 'Home' menu, I was unable to obtain the two GIFs (top of the page and next to 'Flmenco Sundays' lower down on the homepage). So I used a still stock image instead.
2. The 'Find a Table' in the 'Reservation' section leads to an external URL in the real website, I did not include this link in the URL.
3. The 'Book Now' under the 'Brunch', 'Friday Nights Live' and 'Flemenco Sundays' sections lead to an external URL in the main website, again, I did not include these URLs in the mark up.
4. The Facebook and Snapchat links in all the sections do not link to their respective URLs, they link back to the top of the current page.
5. In 'menu.html' and 'wines.html' source code, the food elements (<p> and <span>) have been replicated for the mobile and Ipad versions, so you will find the elements thrice. This is becuase the number of dots between the name and price are different, so a mobile version of those elements had to be created.
6. Certain elements in the 'menu.html' and 'wines.html' have classes labelled between a-z. When all the letters are used up, I switch to a1, a2, a3, etc...
