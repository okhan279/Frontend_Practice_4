      <p class="paragraph-1">
        Following a striking redesign, Bar Gansa proudly welcomes Nacho Rivera
        as its new Head Chef. Rivera’s love for cooking started in his hometown
        in Southern Spain, inspired by the region’s traditional cooking and
        fresh produce. Having worked as a chef in his hometown for ten years,
        Rivera made the move to London two years ago.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here he gained experience working at Donostia and Barrafina, before
        starting his chapter at Bar Gansa. Rivera chose the move to Bar Gansa as
        he was drawn to the authentic Spanish atmosphere and was eager to bring
        a fresh approach to the kitchen.

      <p>
        Rivera has transformed the menu at Bar Gansa with his personal cooking
        style, which brings influences from his Spanish heritage with a modern
        twist. New menu items include Carrileras De Bacalao Con Alioli De Ajo
        Negro, a Tapas dish of cod cheeks with black garlic and aioli. Paella De
        Carne, a twist on the classic Paella, boasts pork shoulder, mushrooms
        and romesco. Chef Nacho’s personal favourite is Chipiron Relleno, a
        delicious stuffed squid with chorizo, Manchego cheese and PX reduction.
      </p>

      <p>
        The new menu pays homage to traditional Spanish cuisine, while the
        restaurant’s refreshing makeover transports patrons into Spain with its
        quirky design, featuring orange seating and brightly patterned décor.
      </p>

      <p>
        On weekends, the Sangria flows with a lively bottomless brunch,
        including three tapas of your choice and ninety minutes of bottomless
        beer or sangria. To add to the vibrant Spanish atmosphere, electrifying
        flamenco displays are hosted by the Escuela de Balle every Sunday from
        8pm.
